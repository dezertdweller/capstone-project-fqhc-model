# Predicting Federally Qualified Health Center Program Funding Levels

## Project Overview
Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) are one of the most essential healthcare providers in the United States, providing care to over [30 million people](https://bphc.hrsa.gov/about-health-center-program/impact-health-center-program) each year, regardless of their ability to pay. As mission-driven organizations, FQHCs provide high-quality healthcare to uninsured and underserved individuals and families in every state. Becoming an FQHC is a long and complex process that requires certain procedures, organizational structures, and ability to manage government funding as they receive a significant government grant to become an FQHC. 

My aim with this project is to predict the estimated Health Center Program funding a new entity could secure given certain information about their patients, community, and organization structure. Potential new organizations could use this estimate to determine if it is worth going through the process to become a health center.
